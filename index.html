        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>An introvert with vibrantly colored hair who loves sales, networking, and tech, crazy right?! I mean, an introvert that’s into tech makes sense but sales and networking involve *gasp!* dealing with people! Yes, I know, I’m a bit of a walking contradiction.</p>
        <p>When I’m not at the keyboard, I enjoy living a nomadic lifestyle visiting and growing my chosen family wherever I can with my husband and our adventure cat, Boe. We bring our fur baby out on various new experiences, such as hiking new trails in remote areas near the Canadian border or kayaking and sailing around. I’m also a bit of a foodie as well as a rucking and festival-going enthusiast.</p>
        <p>As an INTJ I’m 75% introverted but you might not know that from meeting me. My secret as a social introvert is finding that finely tuned balance of being social with a purpose. And my purpose is to connect. I find joy in connecting people to other people and people to products.</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>This is why I fell in love with coding when I lived in SF. Now I help creative entrepreneurs and coaches develop their online presence so that clients come to them.</p>
        <p>It’s my mission to create efficient websites that work for you with organic and paid traffic campaigns.</p>
        <p>After several years of freelancing, I decided to focus on WordPress development in 2020. I’ve been able to utilize my love for both marketing and coding working on plugins.</p>
        <p>Now I want to increase my knowledge, skills and abilities in:</p>
